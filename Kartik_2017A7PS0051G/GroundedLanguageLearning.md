Visually Grounded Neural Syntax Learner (VG-NSL) is an approach for learning syntactic representations and structures without explicit supervision. The modellearns by looking at natural images and reading paired captions. VG-NSL generates constituency parse trees of texts, recursively composes representations for constituents, and matches them with images.
