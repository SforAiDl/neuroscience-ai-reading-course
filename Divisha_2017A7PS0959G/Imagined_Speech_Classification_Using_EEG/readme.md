# Imagined Speech Classification using EEG

Imagined or Covert Speech is thinking in the form of sound, without the intentional movement of any extremities such as the lips, tongue, or hands. It involves both ***auditory*** and ***motor imagery***. There have been multiple studies that tried to recognize the actual words intended to be spoken using brain waves of a person. This can be done through both invasive and non-invasive methods. The invasive methods include implanting electrodes and sensors in the brain surgically. Although this method is much more effective and noise-free, but it is limited to clinical environment only. Among the non-invasive methods we have EEG, MEG and fMRI. Out of these **EEG is the most suitable** as it is simple, economic and handy to implement. 

The research is still in nascent stages and current approaches in recognizing imagined speech can be divided into two, syllable-based and word-based. I'll be discussing one paper from both approaches.
