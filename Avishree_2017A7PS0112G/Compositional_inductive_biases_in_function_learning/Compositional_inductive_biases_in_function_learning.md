## Compositional inductive biases in function learning

**Objective:** Find the inductive biases employed by humans when learning complex functional structures.

**Insight:** We break down complex structures into simpler building blocks. Hence, the authors suggest that *human intuitive theory of functions is inherently compositional*.
